# C-SharpCRUD

This is an example of a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application in C# for you to understand a bit more about c#. This is a wonderful Microsoft Language.
This example uses a simulated "Product" class as the data model and assumes a console application, but the principles can be applied to various C# application types.
